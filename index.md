# Firearms Debate in the US and its Relation to Mass Shootings

##Introduction 

### Abstract:
Gun control is one of the most controversial political topics in the United States. America being one of the world’s most liberal countries in the world, freedom is central amongst its values. But some could say: **“My freedom stops when that of others begins”**. And indeed, the US are regularly torn apart by mass shootings. Gun ownership and the need for regulation can seem incompatible at times. But precisely how is this political debate linked to the occurrences of mass shootings? This is what we intend to find out. Analyzing quotes emanating from American newspapers in the Quotebank dataset combined with additional data will help us study how these tragic events influence the media coverage – and therefore also the political debate – about gun control. This could help us understand the underlying mechanisms of this societal problem, and provide us with tools to help predict future controversy on the matter.

### Research questions

- How do the occurences of mass shootings in the US influence the debate over firearms? 
- What features of the shootings (location, number of fatalities, weapon type/legality...) influence most the size of the following media coverage? For example, are shootings in more democrat states creating a larger media coverage and outrage afterwards? We would like to rank the features by influence on this matter.
- What are the words that are most correlated to the occurences of mass shootings? This would give us insight on how people are talking on the topic (is it more about dwelling on the victims or questionning the right to own a gun?).

### Data used

As our goal was to analyse the relationship between mass shootings and _ _talk_ _ about mass shootings we had to use two different datasets. For the shootings, we used the **"Mother Jone's" dataset**, that we got from https://data.world/awram/us-mass-shootings. This dataset gave us basic information (e.g. date, number of fatalities) about each shooting that occured in the USA between 2015 and 2020, adding also some interesting features such as location, age and gender of the shooter, etc. Our other source of data was the Quotebank data set [INSERT REF], consisting of over 170 mio of quotes emanating from american newspapers. We focused our research on the time lapse between 2015 and 2020. 

## Mass shootings in the US between 2015 and 2020 

First, we need to know where we stand. Between 2015 and 2020, 48 shootings were registered. Due to these events, ??? people died and ??? were injured. Here is a map that let us visualise the location and impact of each of the shootings.
